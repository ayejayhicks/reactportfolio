## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to update my current responsive portfolio to a React portfolio to become more employer competitive. 

## Goal
My goal is to provide a portfolio that is visually appealing. One that allows the reader to learn a bit more about me, that showcases my work, my strengths, weaknesses and to understand my goals moving forward. This portfolio will also set me apart from other developers who do not use some of the latest technologies.

## Description
Provided is my personal portfolio that includes a little about myself, my latest work including group projects, my current Resume and my contact information.

## Challenges and Successes
My biggest challenge was making my portfolio look the way I envisioned it. Using a brand new language to create a portfolio was a huge challenge. I followed up on notes taken in class and watched videos to get a better understanding on how to make things come together. I had success with condensing my portfolio and continuing to implement things that I have learned over the course of the class.

## Motivation
To show a complete portfolio that showcases my work and who I am.

## Technologies Used
React.js  
Bootstrap  
React-Bootstrap
